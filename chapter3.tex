\chapter{Amorphous Germanium as a Blocking Material}
amorphous germanium is special because it is bi-polar blocking
talk about barrier height

can use same method to form passivation on surfaces you dont use as well as ones for contacts.
passivated on non electrode surface is partly to protect inner material, for example pure Ge wont be oxidized, and wont create leakage current over naked surface

on contact surfaces it provides charge injection barriers, blocks injectection of charges from outside the detector, 

fundamentaly we need a barrier to block the injection of holes, p-n junction blocks using coloumb forces
