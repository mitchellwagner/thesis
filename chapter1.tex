\chapter{Introduction and Background}

Since birth, the Earth has been under a constant barrage of particles.
Some can be seen with the naked eye, such as a portion of the light from the sun and stars, while others such as x-rays or microwaves cannot.
The discovery of radioactivity by Henri Becquerel in 1896 when he was studying phosporescence \cite{Mould} coupled with Wilhelm Roentgen's discovery of x-rays in 1895 \cite{wilhelm} kickstarted the search for devices capable of detecting these invisible particles.
